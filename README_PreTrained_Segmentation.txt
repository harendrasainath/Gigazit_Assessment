README for Pre-Trained Segmentation Model Using PyTorch
Overview
This script uses a pre-trained DeepLabV3 model from PyTorch for image segmentation. It segments an image, visualizes the segmentation, and saves the segmentation map to a text file.

 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- TorchVision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Installation
To install the required libraries, use the following commands:
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib pillow

Code Explanation
1. Load the Pre-Trained Model: The DeepLabV3 model is loaded using PyTorch's `torch.hub.load` function.
2. Image Transformation: The input image is transformed to match the model's input requirements.
3. Segment the Image: The model segments the image, and the segmentation map is extracted.
4. Visualize and Save: The segmentation map is visualized using Matplotlib and saved to a text file.

Output
The output file (`challenge_image_segmented_pixels.txt`) contains the segmentation map with integer labels representing different segments.

Advantages
- Provides meaningful segmentation, separating different objects in the image.

Disadvantages
- Requires more dependencies and computational resources.
- Requires knowledge of deep learning frameworks.
